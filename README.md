# Jest Unit Test Sample Project

* Install the same `devDependencies` I have included.
* Run `npm install` to download those dependencies
* Copy my `babel.config.js` file into your project
* Edit your `package.json` and set the `test` script to `jest`
* Create your calculator.test.js file with test cases, based off of my example. It's important to copy lines 1 - 10 to make sure the tests will operate correctly.
* Open a console and run `npm run test`

You want all tests to pass and be green.
